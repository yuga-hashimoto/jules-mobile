          # Use debug keystore for easy testing, or set up release keystore secrets
          # For this MVP, we use the unsigned/debug signed APK or generated debug APK
          # Actually assembleRelease produces unsigned unless configured.
          # Let's stick to assembleDebug for instant testing without keystore setup, 
          # OR configure a basic release build if user provided secrets.
          # Given instructions "make it usable", debug APK is easiest to install side-load.
          # But user asked for "Release". Let's build Release and sign with debug key if no key provided?
          # Easier: Just build debug APK for side-loading.
